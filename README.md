## Quick start examples for integrating [Banuba SDK on iOS](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk-v1/ios/ios_getting_started) into Swift apps.  
The example contains the following usecases:   
- apply effect to video from camera and show it on the screen,  
- apply effect to photo from the gallery,  
- apply effect to video from the gallery,
